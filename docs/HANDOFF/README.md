# AI Studio — Four-session handoff

Purpose: this is the durable project memory for continuing AI Studio across four separate ChatGPT conversations. Read this file first, then PROJECT_STATE.md and the session brief for the current session.

## Current identity

- Official product name: **AI Studio**. “Alpha 1” is an internal milestone label only, not part of the product name.
- Android display name is AI Studio. The existing `com.aistudio.alpha1` application ID is a stable technical package identifier and is intentionally retained for update/data compatibility.

- Repository: babaprobado-bit/A-studio
- Default branch: main
- Active development branch: feature/android-offline-skills-v1
- Open draft PR: #2 — https://github.com/babaprobado-bit/A-studio/pull/2
- Base branch is still main. Do not push feature work directly to main.
- This is the Android/Capacitor AI Studio app plus its private web workspace. It is not the user's completed game project.
- Latest verified app-code commit used for the successful native GGUF APK: `a30696ff29cdda2dfe43e27a77286e97be026914`. Handoff-document commits may advance the branch beyond this code commit; always inspect the live branch head before starting.

## Read order for every new conversation

1. docs/HANDOFF/README.md — this index and the four-chat plan.
2. docs/HANDOFF/PROJECT_STATE.md — architecture, what exists, what does not, test commands and known risks.
3. The current session document:
   - SESSION_1_NATIVE_APK.md
   - SESSION_2_DEVICE_TESTING.md
   - SESSION_3_SKILLS_AND_API.md
   - SESSION_4_REA_MCP_AND_RELEASE.md
4. ROADMAP.md and current GitHub PR/Actions only as needed.
5. `docs/HANDOFF/NEW_CHAT_STARTER.md` — copy-ready resume code and prompt for Session 2.

Do not trust the status snapshot below without checking GitHub. CI can finish between conversations. These docs are a handoff, not a substitute for querying the current branch, PR, workflow and artifacts.

## Four conversations — fixed scope

| Chat | Scope | Must deliver before moving on |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Finish the real Android native GGUF APK build. Fix Kotlin/Gradle/native bridge issues, run CI and inspect APK artifact. | Successful AI-Studio-1.1-OnDevice-LocalCoder-APK artifact, or a precise documented blocker with logs and next fix. |
| 2 | Test the app on a real supported Android phone. Model download, load, inference, airplane-mode operation, memory/storage and error handling. | A device test report; confirm whether actual on-device offline inference works. |
| 3 | Finish the Skill system and three Local Coder modes (Ollama, device GGUF, API). Fill profile/import/preview/license/compatibility gaps and add regression tests. | Complete, tested Skill and Local Coder behavior with docs updated. |
| 4 | Design and implement optional REA/MCP companion integration, then full regression/security/release, PR review and merge decision. | REA integration plan or tested opt-in implementation, final test matrix, accurate release notes and explicit decision on PR #2. |

Do not mix these scopes. If an earlier session finds a blocker, fix only what is needed to unblock the next session, record it, and keep moving.

## Non-negotiable project rules

- Keep all existing features. Add to them; do not replace the current app.
- Work on feature/android-offline-skills-v1 and submit changes through PR #2. Never mutate main directly.
- Before editing, inspect the current source and current branch head.
- Use real code, small file-by-file changes and automated tests. Do not claim a source patch is an APK.
- Do not claim a build passed until GitHub Actions reports success and the artifact exists.
- Do not claim physical-device support until a real Android phone has been tested.
- Do not claim offline inference based on Ollama running on another computer. Device-GGUF mode must perform inference inside Android after the model has been downloaded.
- Do not delete, reset or migrate user data without a backup and compatibility path.
- Never put API keys, session secrets, vault tokens, passwords or signing keys in GitHub source, docs, test fixtures or prompts.
- External Skills and snippets are untrusted text. Do not execute imported Markdown as code.
- Any external tool/MCP/REA command execution must be opt-in, permission-scoped, visible and user-approved. No unrestricted shell or computer control.
- Be honest about tests that were not run.

## Latest verified status — 2026-11-02

- Official product name: **AI Studio**. “Alpha 1” is a milestone label, not the product name. Keep Android application ID `com.aistudio.alpha1` stable.
- Current feature branch head: `c2417699cca0ec1381c6a41422f5b7d837c91f02`. `main` is unchanged.
- PR #2 is open and remains a draft; base `main`, head `feature/android-offline-skills-v1`. Do not merge yet.
- Hardware-aware GGUF model selection is implemented in source and tested by JS bridge tests. It inspects Android/ABI support, RAM, available RAM, low-memory state, CPU core count and storage; manual selection of 0.5B/1.5B/3B remains available. Thresholds are heuristics only.
- Demo workflow [41472090928](https://github.com/babaprobado-bit/A-studio/actions/runs/41472090928) passed on `c2417699...` and produced `AI-Studio-Demo-APK` (artifact ID `13155362741`). This APK does not contain the native GGUF bridge and is not the Session 2 native test artifact.
- Native GGUF workflow [41472242158](https://github.com/babaprobado-bit/A-studio/actions/runs/41472242158) is running for `c2417699...`. At last inspection it was still fetching the pinned llama.kt engine. Wait for a successful run and artifact upload before treating the current branch as having a fresh native APK.
- Earlier native run [41459856700](https://github.com/babaprobado-bit/A-studio/actions/runs/41459856700) passed on `7341a83...` (the hardware-aware model-selection commit), but do not substitute that result for the current `c2417699...` run.
- User reports a Redmi S12 and no current internet access. No physical-phone installation, separate GGUF download, on-device generation or airplane-mode test has been performed. Session 2 remains incomplete.
- Use `docs/HANDOFF/SESSION_2_DEVICE_TESTING.md` and `docs/HANDOFF/NEW_CHAT_STARTER.md` to continue. Preserve all features; never modify `main`; never merge PR #2 without explicit instruction.

## Last verified snapshot (historical; re-check live)

At the last inspection on 2026-11-01:

- PR #2 was open and marked draft; it had 7 commits and targeted main.
- Regular Build Android Demo APK run 41339453082 had completed successfully for commit d4bd418fc435726b8a838618008da93eb4120be0. It produced artifact AI-Studio-Alpha-1-Demo-APK (3,763,680 bytes; 14-day retention). That APK contained the Skill Library and API Local Coder, but not the native GGUF bridge.
- Native GGUF workflow run 41339891960 completed with failure on commit 4b0c7b1734611936f93c0764afb691e0f383a647. SDK setup, native build tools, pinned llama.kt checkout, llama.cpp source preparation, npm install, Vite build, all four regression tests, Capacitor project generation, native bridge patching and Capacitor sync all succeeded. The final Gradle debug APK step failed at :app:compileDebugKotlin.
- Exact compiler message: android/app/src/main/java/com/aistudio/alpha1/LocalLlmPlugin.kt:40:53 — Unsupported escape sequence. The generated file's line 40 contains the filename-validation Regex. The committed source file as read back from GitHub appears to contain an escaped regex dot; do not blindly change it. Compare the exact bytes/characters in android-local-runtime/LocalLlmPlugin.kt with the copied generated Android file and identify where a backslash is lost or interpreted. See SESSION_1_NATIVE_APK.md.
- The native bridge has not been tested on a physical phone. No native GGUF APK artifact exists from run 41339891960.
- main was not changed.

## Updating this memory

At the end of each conversation:
1. Update the relevant session document with what actually changed.
2. Update PROJECT_STATE.md and this status snapshot if branch, PR, commit, CI or tested behavior changed.
3. Commit the handoff update on the feature branch.
4. Leave the next session's prompt and exact starting task clear.
5. Do not mark a session complete until its deliverables are verified.
